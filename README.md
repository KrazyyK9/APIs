# APIs

# About
A repostory filled with my APIs

## How It's Made:
Coding is done with Node.js and JS

**Tech used:** Node.js, Javascript

I work on my API calls to perfect my efficiency


## Optimizations

I look for ways to reduce my run time complexities and revist code to add Big(O) notation. I also am working on refractoring code to use async and await calls



## Lessons Learned:
I have learnt that there are multiple ways to call APIs and the importance of async and await
